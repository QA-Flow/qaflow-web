# Installation

This page provides detailed instructions for installing and configuring QAFlow Reporter in your project.

## Requirements

QAFlow Reporter requires:

- Node.js 14 or higher
- A QAFlow account with an API key

## Installing the Package

Install QAFlow Reporter using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @qaflow/report

# Using Yarn
yarn add @qaflow/report

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @qaflow/report
```

This will add QAFlow Reporter to your project dependencies.

## Configuration Options

### Using the CLI

The easiest way to configure QAFlow Reporter is by using the CLI to generate a configuration file:

```bash
npx @qaflow/report init
```

This will:
1. Prompt you for your QAFlow API key
2. Create a `reporter.config.js` file in your project root
3. Set up the initial configuration

If you already have your API key and want to bypass the interactive prompt:

```bash
npx @qaflow/report init --key=your-api-key-here
```

### Manual Configuration

You can also create the configuration file manually:

1. Create a `reporter.config.js` file in your project root
2. Add the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here'
};
```

### Programmatic Configuration

If you prefer, you can configure QAFlow Reporter programmatically in your code:

```javascript
import reporter from "@qaflow/report";

reporter.initialize("your-api-key-here");
```

## Configuration Options

QAFlow Reporter supports the following configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | string | required | Your QAFlow API key |

## Verifying Installation

To verify your installation and configuration:

1. Create a simple test file with the following content:

```javascript
import reporter from "@qaflow/report";

// Create a simple test
reporter.createTest(
  "Installation Test",
  "Verifying QAFlow Reporter installation",
  { author: "Test User", email: "user@example.com" },
  { name: "Node.js", version: process.version, os: process.platform }
);

// Add a test step
await reporter.step("Verify connection", async () => {
  // This step should pass
});

// End the test
const results = await reporter.end();
console.log("Test completed successfully!");
console.log(results);
```

2. Run the test file:

```bash
node -r esm your-test-file.js
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a successful test result in your console and in your QAFlow dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

- Check that your API key is correct
- Ensure you have an active internet connection
- Verify that your Node.js version is 14 or higher
- Check for any firewall or network restrictions
