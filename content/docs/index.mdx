# Quick Start

Get up and running with QAFlow Reporter in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to integrate QAFlow Reporter into your testing workflow.

## 1. Install the Package

First, install the QAFlow Reporter package using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @qaflow/report
# or
yarn add @qaflow/report
# or
pnpm add @qaflow/report
```

## 2. Create a Configuration File

The simplest way to set up QAFlow Reporter is to create a configuration file with your API key:

```bash
npx @qaflow/report init
```

This interactive command will ask for your API key and create a `reporter.config.js` file. Alternatively, you can specify your API key directly:

```bash
npx @qaflow/report init --key=your-api-key-here
```

## 3. Basic Usage Example

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
// Import the reporter
import reporter from "@qaflow/report";

// Create a test
reporter.createTest(
  "Login Test",
  "Testing the login functionality of our application",
  { author: "QA Tester", email: "tester@example.com" },
  { name: "Chrome", version: "118.0.0", os: "macOS", browser: "Chrome" }
);

// Add test steps
await reporter.step("Navigate to login page", () => {
  // Step implementation
});

await reporter.step("Enter username", () => {
  // Username entry logic
});

await reporter.step("Enter password", () => {
  // Password entry logic
});

await reporter.step("Click login button", () => {
  // Login button click logic
});

// End the test and get results
const results = await reporter.end();
console.log(`Total steps: ${results.summary.total}`);
console.log(`Passed steps: ${results.summary.passed}`);
console.log(`Failed steps: ${results.summary.failed}`);
console.log(`Skipped steps: ${results.summary.skipped}`);
```

## 4. View Your Results

After running your tests, the results will be available in your QAFlow dashboard. You can view detailed information about each test, including:

- Test status (passed, failed, skipped)
- Individual step results
- Error details for failed steps
